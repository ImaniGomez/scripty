## SCRIPTY
Scripty is an app that allows a user to calculate film usage based on various parameters such as shooting speed, reel length, and camera settings, ensuring precise and reliable calculations. The goal is to allow script supervisors to keep calculations, logs, and notes all in one place, minimizing room for error or confusion. 

## LANGUAGE
It is written in Python. 
I chose to write this program in Python because it is simple enough to create calculations, but still has lots of versatility. 

## CURRENT STATE
The project is still very new and in the early development stages. The calculation is built, except it is still missing a few variables to properly output the remaining hours, minutes, and seconds of the film stock. 

## FUTURE PLANS
I would like to let users add their calculations to an editable spreadsheet. Each of their calculations is based on the previous calculation. For example, If they started with 100 minutes of the film and the first take was 7 minutes, their next calculation would start from 103 and go down from there. The user would also be able to create new projects and view their project history.

I would also like to add export options to Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, and PDF. 

Frontend Design will be added eventually.
